## 🚀 Quick Start

### Workflow Summary

#### 1. Visualize the Demo

1. Clone this project folder into your main project.
2. Navigate into it: `cd CodeboxxMobileDemos`
3. Run the demo app: `npx expo start`
4. Explore the demo screens to see available components and concepts.

#### 2. Use the Files in Your Project

1. Copy the components or concepts you want from the `components/` or `concepts/` folders.
2. Paste them into the corresponding folders in your own project.
3. Use the example code from the demo as a reference for implementation.

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### Setup and Visualize the Demo

1. **Open your terminal application**
   - This could be Terminal (Mac), Command Prompt or PowerShell (Windows), or the terminal in Firebase Studio.

2. **Navigate to your main project folder**
   - In the terminal, make sure you are inside the folder where you want to add the demo project. Use `cd` to change directories if needed.

3. **Clone the repository**
   - Run the following command (replace `<repository-url>` with the actual GitHub link):

     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

   - This will create a new folder called `CodeboxxMobileDemos` inside your main project folder.

4. **Go into the demo folder**
   - Change directory into the new folder:

     ```bash
     cd CodeboxxMobileDemos
     ```

5. **Install dependencies**
   - Install all required packages:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

6. **Start the demo app**
   - Launch the demo project:

     ```bash
     npx expo start
     ```

   - Follow the on-screen instructions to open the app on your phone (using Expo Go), a simulator, or your web browser.

## 🧩 Components & Concepts

### How to Use Components

1. Open the `components/` folder inside `CodeboxxMobileDemos`.
2. Copy the file(s) you want (right-click and select Copy).
3. In your own project, go to (or create) a `components/` folder and paste (right-click and select Paste).
4. In the demo app, find the related screen (for example, `CustomButton Demo`).
5. In `app/(tabs)/component-demos/`, open the matching file (for example, `custombutton-demo.tsx`).
6. Copy the example code you need and paste it into your own screen file.
7. Import the component in your code (adjust the path as needed):

   ```tsx
   import CustomButton from './components/CustomButton';
   ```

### How to Use Concepts

1. Open the `concepts/` folder inside `CodeboxxMobileDemos`.
2. Copy the file(s) you want (right-click and select Copy).
3. In your own project, create a `concepts/` folder if it does not exist, and paste the files (right-click and select Paste).
4. In the demo app, find the related screen (for example, `Loops Demo`).
5. In `app/(tabs)/concept-demos/`, open the matching file.
6. Copy the example code you need and paste it into your own screen file.
7. Import the concept file in your code (adjust the path as needed).
